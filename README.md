# Click_Time_Challenge

This project is for the Click_Time internship Challenge.
As part of submission for this project, there is a single Html file - CT_challenge.html
There is no separate CSS file as I have included the style section in-line due to very
few components present.

Aim : To able to navigate to Click time office located in San Francisco, CA from your current location.
Note - I have tested the file in Mozilla and IE 11 and it works fine. For Chrome, you may have to load the file on a server and then run it, Chrome does not allow 
files to use navigation privileges unless they are on a server.

To run : Just open the CT_challenge.html in the browser and allow the browser to use your location for navigation
To change the mode of transport (either to Walking, Bicycling or Transit) there is a drop down provided at the top of the page. The page will reload as soon
as you select any different mode of transport for reaching the destination. The value of the destination has been hard-coded to "282 2nd Street 4th floor, 
San Francisco, CA 94105"

API - I have used the google maps javascript api v3 for this project and have taken help from their documentation - https://developers.google.com/maps
